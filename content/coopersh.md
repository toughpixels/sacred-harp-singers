## Bass Runs
A very few of the songs in the 2012 Cooper SH have "gospelly" runs shown in the music. But we've all been to singings where the basses do something not in the book. [Here are five.](/BassRunSongs.pdf) "Sheet music with bass parts")

## The 2006 to 2012 Tune Book Update

### Using the Tune Index
The Tune Index is now to be found at the back of the book.  It has several new features: tune names which begin with "The" are listed both under the "Ts" and under the 2nd word of the tune name; tunes which appear in both the Denson Sacred Harp and the Cooper Sacred Harp but with different tune names, have both tune names listed; the tune names for minor tunes are printed in bold, making them easy to spot; anthems, duets, and major/minor companions are listed both under their respective tune names and in separate lists on the last page of the Index.

### Songs With A New Page in The 2012 Edition
All songs that were in the 2006 edition are present in the 2012 edition, but a few of them are now on new pages. The 2012 music revision committee apologizes for this but the result is that the moved songs are in much roomier locations and look much nicer and are easier to sight-read.  [New Locations](/CooperSongsMoved.pdf).

### Songs That Are New to the 2012 Edition
After moving the overly-crowded songs to their new locations, the music revision committee found to their joy that there was space in which to add new songs. Some of these are newly composed, and some are older songs inexplicably not in the 2006 edition.

### Songs that gained verses in the 2012 edition (and the few that lost one)
Many songs gained one or more verses, to the great pleasure of singers who have been asking for exactly this. There were a very few songs which had formerly been quite crammed tight with too many words, and these have been put on a diet and now look quite lovely and slim. [Download the list](/CooperChangedVerses.pdf) of all songs with verse changes. Note that living composers were consulted before their songs lost any verses and their approval was obtained.

## Tune Comparisons Between the 1991 Denson and the 2012 Cooper Edition

The quite clever singers in Texas have produced a [comparison list](http://resources.texasfasola.org/tunecomparisonindex.html) looking at the latest editions of the Denson Sacred Harp and the Cooper Sacred Harp, for the tunes that the two books have in common.
