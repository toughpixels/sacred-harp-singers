There are two main ways we stay in touch, an email list, and Facebook groups. Choose what's most covenient for you, or join both!

## Our Email List
We have an email list (through Google Groups) that works as an announcements-only entity. It is called "Seattle Sacred Harp". Once a week, usually about mid-week, an email message is sent out listing the singings that are scheduled to occur the upcoming weekend, or to tell of a change to a regularly scheduled singing, or to announce to everyone a special singing event. When one of our all-day singing weekends draws near, there usually are a couple additional messages per week with advice for those still somewhat new to what all goes on during such events.

You can quickly spot these email messages in your in-box, as the Subject line always includes "Seattle Sacred Harp" ahead of the particular subject selected for that message.

There is no discussion or chit-chat on this list, that's what we mean by "announcements-only". We do all our talking back and forth on the several Facebook groups.

Our email list is "closed" but there are two ways for you to get on it:

1) Navigate in your browser to http://groups.google.com and search for the group called "Seattle Sacred Harp". Ask to join the group. Before too much time passes, one of the administrators will grant your request.

2) One of the moderators can directly add your name and email address to the list of members. When you see one of us at a singing, simply ask to be added, or you can send an email to the address listed below, asking to be added.

Once you have been added, and if you have a google account, you can browse through all the old messages, if you want, by pointing your browser to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/seattlesacredharp

## Facebook
We choose to discuss and share online with one another via Facebook Groups, rather than by way of the email list. We apologize if you don't want to set up a Facebook account and thus get left out of this part of our interaction with one another. You are not alone in this preference. Happily you'll have all the more to share when we meet face to face at one or more of our regularly scheduled singings.

For those who do have Facebook accounts, here are a few to get you started. There are many such groups; generally you can search for Facebook groups that have "sacred harp"  or "shape note" in the name to find more. The icon is a portal to Facebook. If you don't already have an account you can go directly to FB and create an account for yourself. The group names below are portals that will let you log in and then take you directly to the group in FB.
