### Dear Miss Grace Notes:
 I was recently at a singing and I saw a few people passing around a tiny bottle. They seemed to be putting a drop or two of the contents of this bottle on a finger and touching it to their tongues. I'm sure this is not a controlled substance, but what is this all about?

Miss Grace Notes assures you that this was in all likelihood innocent peppermint oil, and she hopes you watched closely because this rite is not for the uninitiated, the timid, or the feeble of breath. (One Yankee we know turned quite purple when he imbibed too much.) Miss Grace Notes hopes you will exercise caution
