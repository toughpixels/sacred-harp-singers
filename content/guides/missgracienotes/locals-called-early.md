### Dear Miss Grace Notes:
 Why do I get called to sing first thing in the morning at our local convention when I'm not yet warmed up?
#### Not A Morning Person

##### Gentle Singer: 
You have Miss Grace Notes' empathy, and an invitation to share a cup of steaming-hot caffeine-enriched beverage just before the singing commences.
   Leading later in the day is analogous to the drinking of "old wine" at the wedding of Cana -- it is sometimes a richer, fuller experience than earlier in the day when our voices are not warmed up. Leading later in the day is reserved for the guests of the convention, while the locals will most graciously drink the "new wine" i.e. lead when our voices are not as warm, thereby affording our guests the more mature fruit of our efforts.
