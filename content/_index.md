We're dedicated to Sacred Harp singing in **Washington State** and a bit beyond! 

Sacred Harp singing is a traditional American form of community singing. It happens without instruments, in four vocal parts printed in shapenotes using the tunebook *The Sacred Harp*. Shapenotes are the musical noteheads, one of four different shapes: the simple oval, a square, a right-sided triangle, and a diamond.

*The Sacred Harp* was first published in **1844**, it missed being the first to use the shapenote technique by about 46 years. Since then, it has been continuously in print.

## All Are Welcome
Any type, quality, or range of voice will find a comfortable and important place with us. If you are new and wondering what it is all about, drop by to listen or, better yet, [join in](/singing). Beginning singers are always welcome and musical reading ability is not a requirement.

At a Sacred Harp singing, there is no admission charge, no choir director, no rehearsal, no performance, no membership -- just singing that many describe as the most powerful and intense musical experience of their lives!
