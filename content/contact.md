There are two main ways we stay in touch:

 - An [email list](https://groups.google.com/search?q=Seattle%20Sacred%20Harp&inOrg=false)
 - Facebook groups

Choose what's most covenient for you!

## Our Email List
We have an announcements-only email list (through [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/seattlesacredharp) called "Seattle Sacred Harp". 

Once a week an email is sent out listing upcoming singings, updates, or announcements for special events. When one of our all-day singing weekends draws near, a couple additional messages might be sent. The Subject line for these emails always includes *"Seattle Sacred Harp"* ahead of the subject for that message.

There is no discussion or chit-chat on this list, it is **announcements-only**. We do all our talking back and forth on the several Facebook groups.

There are three ways for you to join the email list:

1. Find the Google Group called ["Seattle Sacred Harp"](https://groups.google.com/g/seattlesacredharp) and ask to join the group. One of the administrators will grant your request.

2. One of the moderators can directly add your name and email address to the list of members. When you see one of us at a singing, ask to be added.

3. Send an email to the email at the bottom of the page, asking to be added.

Group memebers with a Google account can browse through all the old messages by visiting the [archived messages page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/seattlesacredharp)

## Facebook
We choose to discuss and share online with one another via Facebook Groups, rather than by way of the email list. We apologize if you don't want to set up a Facebook account and thus get left out of this part of our interaction with one another. You are not alone in this preference, happily you'll have more to share when we meet face-to-face.

For those who do have Facebook accounts, there are many sacred harp groups. You can search for "sacred harp" or "shape note" to find more. If you don't already have an account you can go directly to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and create an account for yourself. 

Here are a few of the groups our members sing with.
