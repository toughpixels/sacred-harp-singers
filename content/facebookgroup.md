We choose to discuss and share online with one another via Facebook Groups, rather than by way of the email list. We apologize if you don't want to set up a Facebook account and thus get left out of this part of our interaction with one another. You are not alone in this preference. Happily you'll have all the more to share when we meet face to face at one or more of our regularly scheduled singings.

For those who do have Facebook accounts, here are a few to get you started. There are many such groups; generally you can search for Facebook groups that have "sacred harp"  or "shape note" in the name to find more. The icon is a portal to Facebook. If you don't already have an account you can go directly to FB and create an account for yourself. The group names below are portals that will let you log in and then take you directly to the group in FB.
