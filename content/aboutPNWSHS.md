From its beginning, *PNWSHS Inc.* has underwritten All-Day Singing expenses, often fronting the deposits needed for renting venues, and serving as a safety net should the freewill offering collected at the event not prove generous enough to cover all expenses incurred. The two biggest expenses at all-day singing events are the rent for the venue, and the cost of enough loaner books for everyone. Since 1992 *PNWSHS Inc.* has shouldered this financial burden, for the all-day singings in Seattle, Buckley, Olympia, Portland, and Eugene. As these events have grown and matured, the need for underwriting by *PNWSHS Inc.* has diminished, making funds available for new events.

*PNWSHS Inc.* purchases Denson Sacred Harps and Cooper Sacred Harps, and makes them available for sale or for loan to any of the local monthly singings needing them. A supply of books is also always provided to the All-Day singings and conventions. Any start-up singing may approach PNWSHS and request help getting a supply of books.

## Projects
See the [Projects page]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "PCNWSHS Projects Page") for details of these:
- Travel Grants for singers wishing to attend Camp Fasola in Alabama (either the Adult Camp or the Youth Camp) are available.
- 4-shape Music Camp: We have held two local music camps, and welcome requests from any group along the West Coast, British Columbia, or Alaska.
